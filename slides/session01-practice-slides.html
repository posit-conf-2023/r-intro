# Review &amp; Practice

### Day 1, Session 1

&lt;div class="title-footer"&gt;
  &lt;img src="images/academy-logo.png"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt; September 17, 2023&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

???

We're going to start off with some review of what we've learned for the past several weeks.

# Go to **Conf Session 1 - Review**

&lt;img src="images/session01/campsite_screenshot.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

[conf.posit.academy](https://conf.posit.academy/)
]

???

for this session, we'll be doing our work in the Academy website (conf.posit.academy)

Go ahead and open up the milestone for this Session 1.

## 🚀 Rapid fire review 


&lt;img src="images/session01/your-turn-example.png" width="60%" /&gt;

???

What we'll do:

I'm going to give you a prompt with a short tidyverse task, and you'll work to recreate it. 

You'll do your work in the Quarto document you have open so you have a record of your code. You can create as many new code chunks as you like in here. 


---

&lt;!-- TODO: update --&gt;

# Review challenge

* __Working together__ with your groupmates is encouraged.

--

* After 1-2 minutes, we'll go over the answer together. And then move on to the next question. 

--

* Everyone gets a small prize at the end! 🎉

???

Working together is okay (and encouraged)

We'll go over the answer once I see that most people have finished.

There are 20 prompts -- we may get through all of them (or not). But there will be a prize for everyone at the end.

I should also note that there's a bit of a mish mash of difficulty. But The main idea is that you exercise some tidyverse recall and get warmed up.

# .big-text[`outbreaks`]

???

We'll be working with data about foodborne and waterborne disease outbreaks spread by contact with environmental sources or infected people or animals. I'll refer to this data set as `outbreaks`. It comes from the CDC's National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS).

First things first, let's take a look a what's in this data set. 

So *here* is your first prompt:

# Your Turn 1

Read in the data and explore it. Can you recreate output that looks like this?

What is the **earliest year** on record in this data set? __The latest__? 

Answer the questions by creating two tables that are sorted.

Explore the relationship between `month` and the number of illnesses with a series of **boxplots** like the one to the right. Can you recreate it? 

**Hint:** Try using the `group` aesthetic to tell R that you'd like to create a boxplot for each unique value of `month`.
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="session01-practice-slides_files/figure-html/sol-6-1.png" width="504" /&gt;
]


???

Check documentation for use of the argument that allows you to create a new boxplot for each grouping.

---

## Solution 6

.wide-left[

```r
outbreaks %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = illnesses)) + 
* geom_boxplot(aes(group = month))
```

The outlier here makes it hard to see what's going on. Let's modify this.

But the outlier here makes it hard to see what's going on. Let's modify this.

The outlier we just observed represents the outbreak associated with the highest number of illnesses. Which observation is this?

  1. Display **only** this observation in a table. 

  2. Then, recreate the boxplots **without** this observation.
  
Here is the code we just used to make the boxplots in the last exercise:


```r
outbreaks %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = illnesses)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = month))
```

How many different primary modes of illness are in this data set? How often does each appear in the data?

Order the rows so that the most common primary mode appears at the top.

## Solution 9


```r

  count(primary_mode, sort = TRUE)
```

or...


```r
outbreaks %&gt;%
  count(primary_mode) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(n))

Looks like the most common primary mode for outbreaks in this particular data set is person-to-person.

Notice coord_flip()

If your first inclination was to use count() then you might have come up with an answer like...

## Solution 10 - alternative

.wide-left[

```r

* count(primary_mode, name = "count") %&gt;%

This one, but it's a little less efficient code-wise.

Let's take a closer look at outbreaks for which the primary mode of infection is **Animal Contact**. 

How many Animal Contact outbreaks has each _individual_ state had? Recreate the table below.

* Before you plot, exclude the outlier we previously identified (the outbreak with the max number of illnesses). 

* Color each line by its primary mode.]

Visualize the number of illnesses in **Washington DC**, grouped by **primary mode** of infection using a "violin plot". *Hint:* You may need to investigate `geom_violin()`.

(Don't worry if your plot dimensions look different than the plot below.)


```
## Warning: Groups with fewer than two data points have been dropped.

# Your Turn 18

Calculate new variable for each outbreak: **`fatality_rate`** (the  number of deaths / the number of illnesses, multiplied by 100). 

Then visualize the distribution of the fatality rate with a histogram.

# Your Turn 20 - last one!

Find Washington DC's worst outbreak as defined by its **`hospitalization_rate`** (the  number of hospitalizations / the number of illnesses, multiplied by 100).

* Subset the data so you display observations that are at least 1.5 times greater than DC's mean hopsitalization rate. 

* Your answer should be a tibble with the highest hospitalization rates shown at the top. 

* Any ties should be broken by outbreaks that happened more recently.

```r
outbreaks %&gt;% 
  filter(state == "Washington DC") %&gt;% 
  mutate(hospitalization_rate = hospitalizations / illnesses * 100) %&gt;%
  filter(hospitalization_rate &gt;= 1.60 * mean(hospitalization_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(hospitalization_rate), desc(year))
